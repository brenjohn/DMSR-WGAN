## Project Overview

The **DMSR-WGAN** uses adversarial training to super-resolve dark matter simulations. It generates high-resolution particle distributions from low-resolution inputs. This approach enables:
- Enhanced particle resolution.
- Improved substructure identification.
- Reduced computational cost compared to high-resolution simulations.
